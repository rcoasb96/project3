        <h2>You Are What You Eat</h2>
          <p>It is very important for people to eat healthily. It especially becomes important as you age because your metabolism slows down tremendously around the age of 30. This is why alot of people are most often heavier later in their life, than they were in their teens and 20's. Even though young people tend to have a fast metabolism, how you treat your body in the early years of your life still matters.</p>
          <p>People who eat healthy, tend to have longer lives and statistically have fewer health problems. An average woman should be consuming 2,000 calories per day, and the average man 2,500 calories. On an average day, we should be eating some form of breakfast, lunch and dinner (snacks optional) to reach this goal. Read on below to find
             out what an ideal meal should contain.</p>
        <h3>The Perfect Meal</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Protein</li>
            <li>Carbs</li>
            <li>Fat</li>
            <li>Vegetable</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Bad Eating Habits:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><h4>Skipping breakfast</h4>
              <p>
              Breakfast breaks the overnight fast and fuels the body and the brain and gives you energy for your morning activities and to start your day. When you dont eat
              breakfast, you are basically forcing your body to run without fuel and you will not perform at your highest capacity.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Eating a late dinner</h4>
              <p>
              It is suggested that people eat dinner before 8pm, because studies show that it takes about 2-3 hours for food to completely digest. Your bodies' metabolism decreases
              as the day goes on so it is best to have an early/ligh dinner. Alot of people fall into eating late, whether because of school or work, and this is a bad habit. 
              When you go to sleep on a full stomach or directly after you eat, your body will convert the food to fat. This is one of the causes of weight gain.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Not drinking enough water</h4>
              <p>
                Drinking water us so important for our bodies. Every inch or our bodies, inside and out need water to function. Science tells us that the body can only
                survive 3 days without water, so that should tell you how important it is. It is a known standard that a person should drink 8 glasses of water a day.
                For those who dont know, a glass is considered 8 ounces. So that is 64 ounces. But other scientist believe that amount of water a person should drink is 
                not standard and is dependant on each person. So another common used method to drink half your body weight in ounces.

            the greater the health benefits.
          </p>
        <h3>Benefits Of Regular Physical Activity</h3>

            <li>Feel better - more energy &amp; better mood</li>

          </ul>
        <h3>Types Of Physical Activity That Are Especially Beneficial:</h3>
          <ul id="types">
            <li>Aerobic (cardio) activities - stimulate the heart and breathing rate (heart beats faster, breathe 
              harder). They can be moderate or vigorous in their intensity. If performed at a level of intensity 
              that is too high, aerobic activities become anaerobic ("without oxygen"). Anaerobic exercise is activity 
              that causes you to be quickly out of breath, like sprinting or lifting a heavy weight.
            </li>

            <img class="img" src="images/lift2.jpg" alt="portrait" />
            </div>
            <li>Muscle-strengthening activities - make your muscles stronger. It's important to work all the different 
              parts of the body: your arms, legs, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, hips. These include activities 
              like push-ups, resistance exercises (<a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/1d/75/98/1d7598c89922610b91ccad04fae1166b.jpg">bands</a>,

            <li>Bone-strengthening activities make your bones stronger. They're especially important for children 
              and adolescents. They produce a force on the bones that promotes bone growth and strength. Some 
              bone-strengthening activities include: jumping, running, playing sports.
